## ðŸ§± Code Philosophy

- **No bloat.** Everything should serve a purpose.
- **No Odoo leftovers.** Replace all original branding and structure with 4SureERP equivalents.
- **Automation first.** If it can be automated, prioritize it.
- **Readable, testable, modular.** Every module should be understandable in isolation.
